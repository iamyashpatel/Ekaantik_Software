3.6 Consent
It should be noted that Data Protection Legislation sets a high standard for consent and it  may not always be the easiest or most appropriate lawful basis to rely on for processing  personal data.
Any consent obtained must be freely given, specific and informed. The individual giving  consent must give an unambiguous indication of agreement with a clear, affirmative  action. We must also ensure that, wherever consent is relied on, the data subject is  notified of their right to withdraw such consent at any time, we must offer a simple way of  doing so to that data subject, and we must act on withdrawals of consent as soon as we  Can.
Freely given consent means that an individual has a genuine choice and control over how  their personal data is used. If the individual has no real choice, consent is not freely given  and it will be invalid. Consent should be kept separate from other terms and conditions  wherever possible (e.g. a statement of consent in an employment contract is unlikely to  be considered valid consent).
