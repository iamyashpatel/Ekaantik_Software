3.20 Data Sharing
The Bank abides by the statutory code of practice made under section 121 of the Data  Protection Act 2018 which describes how personal data must be shared between  organisations that are controllers. Data sharing can take place in a routine, scheduled way  or on a one-off basis. Sharing data with a Processor is not covered by the Code.
As per the Code, when considering sharing personal or sensitive data:
you must comply with data protection law;
assess the risks and consider using a Data Protection Impact Assessment (DPIA), if  required; and
it is good practice to have a data sharing agreement.
The data subjects can raise a DSAR request secking information on their personal data  held by the Bank through any of the modes, including, oral, writing or through arny social media site where ICICI Bank has a presence. Upon receiving such request, the  Bank will respond to the data subject without undue delay and at the latest within one  month of receipt of the request which can be extended by a further two months'  period if the request is complex or a number of requests are received from the  individual.
The Bank can refuse to comply with the DSAR where it is manifestly unfounded or  excessive, or it is repetitive. However, if it is concluded that the Bank need not  respond to certain DSAR, we must to be able to justify our decision.
In certain circumstances, while calculating the time available to respond to a DSAR,  the clock can be stopped whilst the Bank is waiting for the requester to clarify their  request.
The Bank can withhold personal data sought under a Data Subject Access Request raised by a data subject, if disclosing it would "adversely affect the rights and  freedoms of others"
Please refer to ICICI Bank's separate Standard Operating Procedure: Data Subject Access  Request (DSAR) for more information, which was reviewed in October 2021.
